# AstroReacts

## Game 

In the Astroreacts game the player flies a spacecraft in an asteroids field. The gamer must avoid flying rocks which is traversed by flying saucers. The player can move using the cursor control keys (arrow keys) on his keyboard and shoot the objects pressing the spacebar.

The user destroys the debris with his weapon which is mounted in the front of his flying machine. The player has ability to enter hyperspace and destroy each rock one piece at a time. The game becomes more difficult as the number of asteroids increases.

The gamer fighting with the asteroids gets points for each block he is able to hit. The score will be displayed at the top. When the player gets hit by any of flying rocks then the game is over.

You do not need to worry! You can always try again. Your score will be saved and displayed in the result table.

## Technologies

To design the platform I used Sketch - the digital design toolkit.
To implement the game I used React and Canvas in es6. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Using this technology it helps me design simple views for each state in my application. Also declarative views make my code more predictable and easier to debug.
